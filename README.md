# Bluff-or-Truth
This is a demo project based on Polynomial Regression to predict the Accurate salary of the different post ie. CEO,manager etc. Such that the hiring work become easy.
This is a demo project so we have kept our dataset small.
So  there is no any need of spliting and labeling the data.
All the program has been written in python on jyupyter notebook.
There is a small comprision between Multiple linear regression and Polynomial Regresssion for this type of data
